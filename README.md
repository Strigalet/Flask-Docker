# Flask-Docker

 a web API (Application Programming Interface) using REST (REpresentational Stateless Transfer) approach and based on MVC (Model, View, Controller) architectural pattern. Our service will allow users to interact with the database and make basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. We will use PostgreSQL as a database because of its robustness and high performance.

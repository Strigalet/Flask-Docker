# Flask-Docker

Web API using REST approach and based on MVC (Model, View, Controller) architectural pattern. This service will allow users to interact with the database and make basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. I've used PostgreSQL as a database because of its robustness and high performance.
